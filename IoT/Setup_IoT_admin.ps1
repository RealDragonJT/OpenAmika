# OpenAmika smart home — the install that needs administrator rights, done once: Eclipse Mosquitto, the MQTT
# broker zigbee2mqtt and OpenAmika's smart-home server talk through (winget). The Silicon Labs CP210x USB-UART
# driver (the SONOFF Zigbee Dongle Plus MG24 is a CP2102N; without it Windows shows the dongle with "code 28" and no
# COM port) is installed by Install_CP210x_driver.ps1; Setup_IoT_admin.bat runs both. Everything else (zigbee2mqtt,
# the OpenAmika IoT server, configuration) needs no elevation and is set up by the OpenAmika launcher / this folder.
# Run from an elevated PowerShell:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Setup_IoT_admin.ps1
